/**
 * @dev Answering specific queries to the like the result of a join or an exit may be too difficult.
 * Then, a very simple way to do that is to 'simulate' the action being queried.
 * To guarantee the simulation won't perform any changes, it forces a revert at the end of the call.
 * The trick is to include the result as part of the revert reason, so it can be decoded by the caller.
 *
 * This contract provides a main query function that allows concatenating different queries.
 * It is not expected to be used from third-party contracts, but from any off-chain consumer through static calls.
